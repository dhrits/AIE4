Is there any way to modify this dimension? - One can always pass the `dimensions` optional parameter with the embedding API which can create smaller sized embeddings (works with `text-embedding-3`) or just use `text-embedding-3-large` which is of size 3072 if a larger embedding size is needed.\n",
    "3. What technique does OpenAI use to achieve this? - Per the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases) it appears the embeddings were trained using [Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) which uses nested neural networks to obtain different levels of understanding for different embeddings with the lower levels learning more global features and higher levels learn more granular features. \n",

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

      "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on what you're trying to achieve, but generally, there are a few common practices you can follow to make your loops clear, efficient, and Pythonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "### For Loops\n",
      "If you're iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), using a `for` loop is a great choice:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a for loop\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### While Loops\n",
      "If you need to continue looping until a specific condition is met, a `while` loop might be more appropriate:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a while loop\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Tips\n",
      "1. **Use Describe Variable Names**: Ensure your loop variables have meaningful names for better readability.\n",
      "2. **Keep it Simple**: Try to keep your loop concise. If you find a loop getting too complex, consider refactoring it into a function.\n",
      "3. **Break and Continue**: Use `break` to exit a loop prematurely and `continue` to skip the current iteration and move to the next one if needed.\n",
      "4. **Use Enumerate**: If you need the index of items in a list, consider using `enumerate`:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "        print(index, fruit)\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Be careful with your exit conditions to avoid accidentally creating an infinite loop.\n",
      "6. **List Comprehensions**: If you're generating lists, consider using list comprehensions for a more concise syntax:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Choosing between a `for` loop and a `while` loop, and following best practices, can significantly improve the clarity and maintainability of your code. Happy coding! If you have any specific use cases or further questions, feel free to ask!\n"

When training such representations, it\\nis often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each down-\\nstream task are unknown. In this context, rigid fixed-capacity representations\\ncan be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us\\nto ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple down-\\nstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is\\nMatryoshka Representation Learning (MRL ) which encodes information at\\ndifferent granularities and allow',\n",
