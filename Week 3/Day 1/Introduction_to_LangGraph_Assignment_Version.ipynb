    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model like BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and relevant information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model (such as GPT-3, BERT, or T5) uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to additional information from the retrieval step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and other applications requiring detailed and specific information.'"

It uses techniques from information retrieval, such as keyword matching, semantic search, or more advanced methods like dense retrieval using neural networks.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system generates a response based on the retrieved information and the input query. It typically uses a language model, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text.\\n\\n### How RAG Works:\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query or prompt from the user.\\n2. **Retrieval Step**: The retrieval component searches a large database or corpus to find the most relevant documents or pieces of information related to the query.\\n3. **Augmentation Step**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input query, providing additional context and details.\\n4. **Generation Step**: The generation component uses the augmented input to generate a response. The language model takes into account both the original query and the retrieved information to produce a more accurate and informative answer.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG:\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By incorporating relevant information from a large corpus, the system can generate responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate.\\n- **Knowledge Integration**: The system can leverage external knowledge sources, making it more knowledgeable and capable of providing detailed answers.\\n- **Flexibility**: RAG systems can be applied to various tasks, including question answering, summarization, and conversational agents.\\n\\n### Applications:\\n- **Customer Support**: Providing accurate and contextually relevant answers to customer queries.\\n- **Educational Tools**: Assisting students with detailed explanations and information retrieval.\\n- **Content Creation**: Helping writers and content creators generate high-quality content based on extensive research.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models, leading to more effective and intelligent AI systems.\",\n",

       "   'output': \"The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) system has introduced several significant improvements, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and other AI models. Here are some key advancements:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters. This reduces the computational and memory overhead compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.\\n\\n2. **Performance Gains**: Studies have shown that LoRA can unlock the performance of higher-rank models, achieving significant improvements in model accuracy and effectiveness. For instance, training with LoRA rank 16 and rank 256 showed little difference, but using rsLoRA (a variant) almost doubled the performance difference between the base model and rank 16 LoRA.\\n\\n3. **Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning**: In federated learning settings, LoRA has been adapted to improve communication efficiency. Techniques like FLASC apply sparsity to LoRA during communication, allowing clients to locally fine-tune the entire LoRA module. This method has shown to match the performance of dense LoRA with up to 10 times less communication.\\n\\n4. **Scalability and Flexibility**: LoRA's design allows for scalable and flexible implementation, making it suitable for various IoT applications. The architecture of LoRa networks, for instance, has been improved to ensure scalability and flexibility through decoupled modules and a messaging system based on streaming data.\\n\\n5. **Open-Source Contributions**: The LoRA system has benefited from open-source contributions, which have facilitated the development and implementation of cost-effective and flexible LoRa networks. This has enabled users to build private LoRa networks for various IoT applications conveniently.\\n\\n6. **Robustness and Privacy**: In federated learning, LoRA has been studied for its robustness to heterogeneity and privacy. The approach has shown benefits in terms of heterogeneity and privacy relative to existing approaches tailored to these specific concerns.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA has become a popular and essential technique for fine-tuning large models efficiently, with significant improvements in performance, communication efficiency, scalability, and flexibility.\",\n",

      "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a new dataset to adapt it to a specific task. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on a large, general dataset, allowing it to perform well on a new, often smaller, and more specific dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Steps in Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "1. **Pre-training**: Train a model on a large, general dataset.\n",
      "2. **Fine-tuning**: Continue training the pre-trained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benefits of Fine-Tuning:\n",
      "- **Efficiency**: Reduces the amount of data and computational resources needed.\n",
      "- **Performance**: Often leads to better performance on the specific task compared to training a model from scratch.\n",
      "- **Adaptability**: Allows models to be adapted to various tasks with relatively minor adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Context:\n",
      "Fine-tuning became particularly prominent with the advent of deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The concept has been around for a while, but it gained significant attention with the success of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) in the late 2010s.\n",
