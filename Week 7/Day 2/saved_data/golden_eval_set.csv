And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.']","Some differences between ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" and the first film include the longer runtime of over 2 hours for the second film, compared to the first.

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch.

The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.']","Derek Kolstad enhanced the John Wick series by deepening and beautifying the story, especially evident by the third film.",multi_context,"[{'source': 'john_wick_3.csv', 'row': 10, 'Review_Date': '17 May 2019', 'Review_Title': "" It's got its own action style!\n"", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw4860412/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'ahmetkozan', 'Rating': 9, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 3', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 28, 19, 6, 0, 158483)}, {'source': 'john_wick_1.csv', 'row': 17, 'Review_Date': '27 February 2016', 'Review_Title': ' The man who kills the Boogeyman\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3422991/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'Horst_In_Translation', 'Rating': 8, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 26, 19, 6, 0, 156042)}]",True

John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity."", "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""]",The answer to given question is not present in context,multi_context,"[{'source': 'john_wick_1.csv', 'row': 0, 'Review_Date': '6 May 2015', 'Review_Title': ' Kinetic, concise, and stylish; John Wick kicks ass.\n', 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3233896/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'lnvicta', 'Rating': 8, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 26, 19, 6, 0, 155968)}, {'source': 'john_wick_1.csv', 'row': 9, 'Review_Date': '20 October 2014', 'Review_Title': "" The coolest action film you'll see all year\n"", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw3107759/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'trublu215', 'Rating': 9, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 1', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 26, 19, 6, 0, 156015)}]",True
81,What sets John Wick 3's action apart from shaky-cam and fast edits?,"["": 16\nReview: John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.""]",John Wick 3's action is set apart from shaky-cam and fast edits by its clear visibility of all action scenes and extraordinary stunts.,reasoning,"[{'source': 'john_wick_3.csv', 'row': 16, 'Review_Date': '16 May 2019', 'Review_Title': "" Finally an action franchise than doesn't lose its touch!\n"", 'Review_Url': '/review/rw4858493/?ref_=tt_urv', 'Author': 'Dannyboi94', 'Rating': 8, 'Movie_Title': 'John Wick 3', 'last_accessed_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 9, 28, 19, 6, 0, 158513)}]",True

After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car.
